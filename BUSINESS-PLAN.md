# 1. MARKET ANALYSIS

## 1.1 Indian Maternity Wear Market

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| India maternity wear market size (2025 est.) | ₹4,800–5,500 Cr (~$575–660M) |
| CAGR (2024–2030) | 8–10% |
| Online share of maternity wear sales | ~30–35% and growing |
| Annual births in India | ~24 million |
| Urban births (target segment) | ~7–8 million |
| Average spend on maternity clothing (urban, middle-class) | ₹8,000–₹20,000 per pregnancy |

**Key growth drivers:**
- Rising disposable incomes in Tier 1 & 2 cities
- Social media influence — pregnant women want Instagram-worthy maternity looks
- Shift from "adjusting with loose clothes" to purpose-built maternity wear
- Nuclear families = more personal spending on self
- Work-from-home culture increasing demand for comfortable yet presentable clothing

## 1.2 Target Customer Persona

**Name:** "Priya" — The Conscious Urban Mom

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Age** | 26–35 |
| **Location** | Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Pune (Tier 1 cities) |
| **Household income** | ₹12–30 LPA |
| **Profession** | IT professional, designer, entrepreneur, freelancer |
| **Education** | Graduate/Post-graduate |
| **Values** | Sustainability, comfort, artisan craftsmanship, natural fabrics |
| **Style** | Boho, earthy, free-spirited — thinks Anthropologie, not H&M |
| **Shopping behavior** | Instagram discovery → D2C website purchase |
| **Pain points** | Can't find stylish maternity wear that isn't synthetic/polyester; existing options are too "clinical" or boring |
| **Willingness to pay** | ₹1,500–₹4,500 per piece for quality, handcrafted clothing |
| **Social media** | Active on Instagram, Pinterest; follows maternity influencers |

## 1.3 Competitor Analysis

| Brand | Location | Price Range | Aesthetic | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-------|----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **Morph Maternity** | Bangalore | ₹999–₹3,999 | Corporate, functional | Established (15+ yrs), wide range, nursing-friendly | Basic designs, polyester-heavy, no artisan feel |
| **Momzjoy** | Mumbai | ₹799–₹2,999 | Affordable, trendy | Eco-friendly positioning, wide collection, affordable | Mass-market aesthetic, limited handcraft |
| **Wobbly Walk** | Noida | ₹699–₹2,499 | Casual, colorful | Budget-friendly, good prints | Very casual, synthetic fabrics, no boho vibe |
| **Nine Maternity** | Multi-city | ₹1,299–₹3,499 | Classic, functional | Retail + online presence | Conservative designs, no artisan element |
| **PinkBlush (US)** | International | ₹2,500–₹6,000+ (equiv.) | Boho, trendy | Strong boho aesthetic, great photography | Not available in India, high prices, no Indian context |
| **Zara/H&M Maternity** | Global | ₹1,499–₹4,999 | Fast fashion | Brand trust, trendy | No India-specific designs, sustainability concerns, inconsistent sizing |

## 1.4 Market Gap — Maya's Opportunity

**No Indian brand currently occupies the "bohemian artisan maternity" space.**

The gap:
- **Morph/Momzjoy/Wobbly Walk** = functional & affordable but aesthetically basic
- **PinkBlush/Western brands** = boho but not accessible in India, no artisan craftsmanship
- **Boutique Indian brands** = beautiful fabrics but NOT maternity-specific (no bump-friendly cuts)

**Maya fills the whitespace:** Indian artisan craftsmanship (chikankari, block print, hand embroidery) + maternity-specific cuts + bohemian aesthetic + natural fabrics.

## 3.3 Embroidery Sourcing

### Chikankari (Lucknow)

| Type | Rate/Piece | Turnaround | Quality |
|------|-----------|------------|---------|
| Machine chikankari (basic) | ₹80–₹150 | 7–10 days | Uniform, good for volume |
| Semi-hand (machine + hand finish) | ₹200–₹400 | 15–21 days | Good balance of cost & quality |
| Pure hand chikankari | ₹500–₹1,500+ | 21–45 days | Premium, artisan story |

**How to source:** Visit Chowk area in Lucknow or connect through IndiaMART. Many artisan clusters accept orders via WhatsApp. Send cut panels, they embroider and return. MOQ typically 20–50 pieces.

### Machine Embroidery (Bangalore)

| Type | Rate/Piece | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Computerized embroidery (small motif) | ₹30–₹80 | Fast turnaround, consistent |
| Computerized embroidery (all-over) | ₹100–₹250 | Good for yoke designs |
| Hand embroidery (local) | ₹150–₹500 | Bangalore has Kerala/Karnataka embroidery artisans |

### Cost Comparison: Machine vs Hand

| Factor | Machine Embroidery | Hand Embroidery |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Cost per piece | ₹30–₹250 | ₹150–₹1,500 |
| Turnaround | 1–3 days | 7–45 days |
| Consistency | High | Variable (charm!) |
| Storytelling value | Low | Very High |
| MOQ | 50+ typically | 20+ |

**Recommendation for Maya:** Use a MIX — machine embroidery for volume pieces (entry-level tops), hand chikankari/mirror work for hero pieces (dresses, occasion wear). This keeps costs manageable while maintaining the artisan story.

```
DESIGN (Week 1-2)
  ↓ Sketches → Tech packs → Fabric selection
SOURCING (Week 2-4)
  ↓ Order fabric → Order trims → Order embroidery panels
SAMPLING (Week 4-6)
  ↓ First sample → Fit testing (on pregnant models!) → Revisions → Final sample
PRODUCTION (Week 6-10)
  ↓ Cutting → Embroidery → Stitching → Finishing
QC (Week 10-11)
  ↓ Measurement check → Stitch quality → Wash test → Iron/press

```

**Total cycle from design to live: ~12–14 weeks for new collection.**
Reorders of existing designs: 4–6 weeks.

## 6.2 Initial Inventory Strategy

**Start LEAN:**

| Phase | Quantity Per Style | Total SKUs | Total Pieces |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|
| Pre-launch (test) | 20–30 per style/color | ~10 | ~250 pieces |
| Launch (Month 1-2) | 50 per style/color | ~28 | ~700 pieces |
| Growth (Month 3-6) | 80–100 per style/color | ~35 | ~2,000 pieces |

**Size ratio per 50 pieces:** XS: 4 | S: 10 | M: 15 | L: 12 | XL: 6 | XXL: 3
(Adjust based on sales data after Month 1.)

**Dead stock strategy:** Offer "Last Few" section at 20% off. If still unsold after 3 months, run flash sale at 40% off. Never go beyond 40% — protects brand.

## 6.3 Warehouse & Storage

**Phase 1 (Month 1-6): Home / Small Room**
- A spare room or portion of the founder's home
- Cost: ₹0–₹5,000/month
- Need: garment racks, shelving, packing table, good lighting for photos
- 250–700 pieces easily fits in a 10×10 room

**Phase 2 (Month 6-12): Shared Warehouse**
- Co-warehousing in Bommanahalli / Electronic City area
- Cost: ₹8,000–₹15,000/month for 200–400 sq ft
- Or use a 3PL (Shiprocket Fulfillment, Delhivery Direct)

## 6.4 Shipping Partners

| Partner | Service | Rates (approx.) | Best For |

# 7. GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY

## 7.1 D2C Website — mayamama.com

**Platform:** Shopify (recommended for Indian D2C)
- Plan: Basic Shopify (₹1,994/month or ~$24)
- Payment: Razorpay integration (2% fee)
- Essential apps: Shiprocket, WhatsApp chat (Zoko/Wati), Reviews (Judge.me), Email (Klaviyo)

**Website must-haves:**
- Beautiful lifestyle photography (maternity models in nature/boho settings)
- Size guide with bump measurement instructions
- "Shop by trimester" navigation
- "The Maya Story" — founder story, artisan connections
- Blog: pregnancy style tips, artisan spotlights

## 7.2 Instagram Strategy

**Handle:** @mayamama.in (or @shopmaya.in)

**Content pillars:**
1. **Product** (40%) — Styled shoots, reels showing details, fabric close-ups
2. **Community** (30%) — Real moms wearing Maya, UGC, pregnancy journey features
3. **Behind-the-scenes** (20%) — Artisan stories, fabric sourcing trips, production process
4. **Education** (10%) — Pregnancy style tips, bump-friendly dressing guides

**Posting cadence:** 4–5 feed posts/week + daily stories + 3 reels/week

**Hashtag strategy:** #maternityfashion #bohomaternity #pregnancystyle #maternitywear #indianmaternitywear #bumpstyle #maternityindia #bohopregnancy #handcraftedmaternity

**Growth tactics:**
- Collab posts with maternity influencers
- "Tag a mom-to-be" giveaways
- Pregnancy announcement styling guides (shareable content)
- Pinterest cross-posting (high intent for maternity shopping)

## 7.3 Influencer Marketing

**Tier strategy:**

| Tier | Followers | Cost | Expected ROI | Qty/Month |
|------|-----------|------|-------------|-----------|
| Nano (real moms) | 1K–10K | Free product (₹2,000–₹4,000 value) | 3–5 orders per collab | 10–15 |
| Micro | 10K–50K | Product + ₹5,000–₹15,000 | 10–25 orders | 3–5 |
| Mid | 50K–200K | ₹20,000–₹50,000 | 30–80 orders | 1–2 |
| Macro | 200K+ | ₹50,000–₹2,00,000 | Brand awareness | Wait until Month 6+ |

**Target influencers (types):**
- Maternity & parenting: pregnancy journey creators
- Sustainable fashion: eco-conscious style creators
- Bangalore lifestyle: local city influencers
- Boho/indie fashion: general boho aesthetic creators

**Budget:** ₹30,000–₹50,000/month for first 3 months (mostly nano + micro)

## 7.4 Marketplace Strategy

**Phase 1 (Month 1-3):** D2C only (mayamama.com). Build brand, collect reviews, iterate on product.

**Phase 2 (Month 4-6):** Add **Myntra** (best for fashion discovery in India)
- Myntra commission: 25–35% (high, but massive reach)
- List bestsellers only; keep exclusive designs for D2C

**Phase 3 (Month 6-12):** Add **Ajio** (boho/indie audience fits well) and **Amazon** (volume play)
- Amazon commission: 17–22%
- Ajio: 25–30%

**Rule:** Always price 10% higher on marketplaces vs D2C site to protect direct margins and incentivize website purchases.

# 9. RISK FACTORS & MITIGATION

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Low initial traction | Medium | High | Start with waitlist, influencer seeding pre-launch; pivot designs based on feedback fast |
| Sizing issues → high returns | Medium | High | Invest in fit testing with real pregnant women; detailed size guide with video |
| Supply chain delays (artisan work) | High | Medium | Keep 2 suppliers per category; maintain buffer stock of bestsellers |
| Cash flow crunch (inventory-heavy) | Medium | High | Start with 50-pcs batches; reinvest revenue; consider pre-orders |
| Copycat competition | Low (initially) | Low | Brand story + artisan relationships = hard to copy; move fast |
| Seasonal demand variation | Medium | Medium | Maternity is year-round (not seasonal); but wedding/festival season = push occasion wear |

# 10. SUMMARY & NEXT STEPS

## The Maya Opportunity

India has 24 million births/year. Urban, style-conscious mothers are an underserved segment — existing maternity brands are functional but aesthetically uninspiring. No Indian brand owns the "bohemian artisan maternity" space. Maya can be the PinkBlush of India, but with an authentic Indian artisan story.

## Immediate Action Items (This Month)

1. **Register business** — Sole proprietorship or LLP; get GST registration
2. **Trademark "Maya"** — File TM application (₹4,500 via IP India)
3. **Visit Chickpet** — Source 5 fabrics for sampling
4. **Find a tailor** — Rajajinagar/Bommanahalli; get 3 samples made
5. **Start Instagram** — Begin posting brand journey content TODAY
6. **Order labels & packaging** — IndiaMART; 4–6 week lead time
7. **Set up Shopify** — Start building the store in parallel
8. **Plan Jaipur trip** — Source block prints and connect with artisans
9. **Build waitlist** — Simple landing page with email capture

## Capital Required

| Scenario | Amount | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Ultra-lean launch** | ₹5–7 Lakhs | Minimal inventory, organic marketing only |
| **Recommended launch** | ₹12–15 Lakhs | Comfortable inventory + marketing budget for 6 months |
| **Aggressive launch** | ₹20–25 Lakhs | Larger inventory + influencer + marketplace fees |

**Recommendation: Start with ₹12–15 Lakhs. This gives you enough runway for 2 production cycles and 6 months of marketing while you find product-market fit.**
